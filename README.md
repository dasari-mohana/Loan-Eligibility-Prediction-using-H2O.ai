# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-using-H2O.ai


## Business Objective
When a customer applies for a loan at our company, we use statistical models to determine whether or not to grant the loan based on the likelihood of the loan being repaid. The factors involved in determining this likelihood are complex, and extensive statistical analysis and modelling are required to predict the outcome for each individual case.

## Aim

Implement a model that predicts if a loan should be granted to an individual based on the data provided

## Tech Stack

➔ Language : Python

➔ Libraries : Scikit-learn, H2O, pandas, numpy, flask, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Dataset Description

The dataset used is an anonymized synthetic data that was generated specifically for use in this project. The data is designed to exhibit similar characteristics to genuine loan data. In this dataset, you must explore and cleanse a dataset consisting of over 1,00,000 loan records to determine the best way to predict whether a loan applicant should be granted a loan or not.

## Data files

The dataset consists of the following fields:
1. Loan ID: A unique Identifier for the loan information.
2. Customer ID: A unique identifier for the customer. Customers may have more
than one loan.
3. Loan Status: A categorical variable indicating if the loan was given to this
customer
4. Current Loan Amount: This is the loan amount that was either completely paid
off, or the amount that was defaulted. This data is for previous loan
5. Term: A categorical variable indicating if it is a short term or long term loan.
6. Credit Score: A value between 0 and 800 indicating the riskiness of the
borrower’s credit history.
7. Years in current job: A categorical variable indicating how many years the
customer has been in their current job.
8. Home Ownership: Categorical variable indicating home ownership. Values are
"Rent", "Home Mortgage'', and "Own". If the value is Own, then the customer
is a homeowner with no mortgage
9. Annual Income: The customer's annual income
10. Purpose: A description of the purpose of the loan.
11. Monthly Debt: The customer's monthly payment for their existing loansYears
of Credit History: The years since the first entry in the customer’s credit
history •
12. Months since last delinquent: Months since the last loan delinquent payment
13. Number of Open Accounts: The total number of open credit cards
14. Number of Credit Problems: The number of credit problems in the customer
records.
15. Current Credit Balance: The current total debt for the customer
16. Maximum Open Credit: The maximum credit limit for all credit sources.
17. Bankruptcies: The number of bankruptcies
18. Tax Liens: The number of tax liens.

## My Approach

1. EDA

    ● Missing data analysis

    ● Data imputation

    ● Bad features removal

    ● Features boxplot and distribution analysis basis visualization

2. Data cleaning / Pre-processing (outlier/missing values/categorical)

    ● One Hot encoder for categorical variables

    ● Label encoder if feature needs to be discretized

3. Feature Engineering

    ● Non-linear combination of existing features

    ● Add pre-calculated priors as features

4. Standardizing data
  
    ● Standard scaler

5. Modelling

    ● Random Forest

    ● Boosting Models

    ● Light GBM

    ● XGBoost

    ● GBT

    ● Neural Network & variants

6. Hyper parameter tuning

    ● GridSearchCV to find out the best model

7. Finalise Model - Model which has the best AUCPR on the labeled test data would be used. Although AUC and F1 score would also be tracked, the
following metrics are also taken into account
     
     ● Precision/Recall
     
     ● AUC
     
     ● AUCPR
     
     ● F1 Score

## Repository Code Overview

1. input -  The input folder contains all the data that we have for analysis.

2. src - It contains the original ipython notebook of Loan Eligibility Prediction

3. output - It contains all the models that I trained for this data saved as reusable files. These models can be easily loaded and used for future use
and the user need not have to train all the models from the beginning.
